            <h1>Behind the Dough</h1>
            <p>
                Here's the scoop from Doughp's founder on how this flavor came to be: "I first made Red Velvet on a total whim, just a few months into business in 2017. One day, while mixing up Doughp at our original commercial kitchen in Oakland, I left to grab some lunch at a nearby bakery.

                I saw an absolutely delicious-looking red velvet cake in their dessert case and immediately thought: I NEED to know what this tastes like in cookie dough! I bought the cake and mixed it right into a small 5lb batch of Doughp; cream cheese frosting, cake and all! HEAVEN by the spoonful!"

            <p>
                "It’s just so Doughp! I didn’t know what to expect, but I am so addicted now. Every flavor was delicious and I honestly can’t wait to try even more!"

                Andrew J.


                "Great product. Absolutely loved Doughp. Tasted great, came quickly and I love a good cause. Was happy I chose the four pack so that I could try a few flavors."

                Emely W.


                "Life changing! This is something you absolutely need to indulge in. Our entire family is obsessed."
